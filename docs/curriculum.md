# Curriculum

6-DOF sim (`starship.sim`, values in `docs/starship.md`). One change per stage; promotion at ≥ 90 % eval landings in 2 consecutive evals.

## Environment

- **Actions**: 3 Bernoulli engine-on heads; 8 continuous (shared throttle, shared 2-axis gimbal, 4 flaps, roll RCS) as absolute targets; actuator lag and rate limits come from the sim.
- **Observations** (body frame, heading-invariant): up vector, velocity, pad position, angular velocity, altitude, flap angles, engine spool, throttle, gimbal, fuel fraction. Port/starboard mirror as augmentation.
- **Reward**: γΦ(s′) − Φ(s) shaping on distance, speed above a safe descent profile and tilt near the ground; penalties on angular rate and actuator jerk; fuel and time cost; terminal landing bonus scaled by fuel left, crash penalty scaled by limit excess.
- **Termination**: landed, crashed, out of bounds, timeout, **tumbled** (pitch > 115° from vertical, pitch/yaw rate > 40°/s, or roll rate > 90°/s) with the largest penalty.
- **Metrics**: landing rate; touchdown speed, tilt, miss; crash and tumble breakdown by limit; reward per term; per-actuator usage and saturation; plasticity (`starship-diagnose`).

## Stages

| # | change | status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | upright near the ground, engines lit (landing burn only) | passed (land3d_v6, it 1574) |
| 1 | engines off at spawn (light them in time, 2 s spool) | |
| 2 | low-altitude belly-flop (flip + burn) | |
| 3 | 3 km belly-flop | |
| 4 | altitude, speed, offset, pitch, spin ranges | |
| 5 | wind and other `docs/gaps.md` items | |

## Findings

- Crash penalties must stay bounded but keep ranking crashes (log of the weighted limit excess); linear ones swamped the value targets (−1,300), hard caps made every bad crash equal.
- Terminal ordering matters: with timeouts cheaper than crashes, policies climbed away from the ground.
- Tumble checks must exclude roll: roll inertia is ~18× smaller, random flaps spun it past 40°/s.
- Without horizontal-speed shaping and an upright term over the whole spawn range, policies tipped over and flew off sideways; with both, landings appeared at ~250 it and stage 0 passed (a 97 % peak, one collapse, recovered by rollback). A second seed reproduced it.
- Lower exploration noise on the continuous heads (std 0.2 vs 0.5) did not help.

## Carried over from 2D

- Shaping must be γΦ′ − Φ with zero terminal potential; otherwise it biases or pays for survival.
- Speed shaping only above a safe descent profile; braking at any altitude makes policies hover.
- Fixed lr; rsl_rl's adaptive schedule pinned it at 1e-2. Reward scaling and value normalization hurt.
- entropy_coef 0.002 with lr 1e-4 made policies decisive and broke plateaus.
- Near-ground starts first; the full scenario alone was not learnable.
